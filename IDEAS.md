# Ideas
- [ ] Add tag filtering to web view
- [ ] Add meta nodes in web view of tags
- [x] Make graph view more circular without a harsh boundary so the graph doesnt squish
- [x] Support zooming in web view
- [ ] Add a --desc shorthand for --description flag, make similar 4 letter abbreviations for other long flags.
- [x] Add an information pannel showing the full description for the selected node in the graph view
- [ ] Let the graph handle inserted/deleted nodes without jostling the whole thing
- [ ] Add arrows to the springs so its clear which direction the dependency is, the pointy bit of the arrow should be on the dependant task to present a logical flow of following the arrows until completion
- [ ] Enable theming support as a configuration option for `bn gui`
- [ ] Make tests use a separate bn storage that isn't the actual repo's storage to avoid polluting the real task graph with test fixtures
- [ ] Offer to include auto-approve rules for copilot, codex, opencode, and claude
- [ ] Add the concept of a question that can be linked to any other resource type, and a user then links an answer off of it
- [ ] Make `bn gui` automatically pick the first available port
