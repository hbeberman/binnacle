# Ideas
- [ ] Add tag filtering to web view
- [ ] Add meta nodes in web view of tags
- [ ] Make graph view more circular without a harsh boundary so the graph doesnt squish
- [ ] Support zooming in web view
- [ ] Add a --desc shorthand for --description flag, make similar 4 letter abbreviations for other long flags.
- [ ] Add an information pannel showing the full description for the selected node in the graph view
- [ ] Let the graph handle inserted/deleted nodes without jostling the whole thing
- [ ] Add arrows to the springs so its clear which direction the dependency is, the pointy bit of the arrow should be on the dependant task to present a logical flow of following the arrows until completion
