Run `bn orient --type worker` to get oriented with the project. Read PRD.md and use your binnacle skill to determine the most important next action, then take it, test it, report its results, and commit it. Run `bn ready` to find available tasks and bugs. IMPORTANT: Prioritize queued items first (items with "queued": true in the JSON output) - these have been explicitly marked as high priority by an operator. Among queued items, pick by priority (lower number = higher priority). If no queued items exist, pick the highest priority non-queued item. Claim your chosen item with `bn task update ID --status in_progress` or `bn bug update ID --status in_progress`, and start working immediately. LSP GUIDANCE: Use your LSP tool for code navigation - goToDefinition, findReferences, hover for type info, and documentSymbol to understand file structure. LSP is more accurate than grep for finding symbol usages and understanding code. CRITICAL: When you finish, close the item with `bn task close ID --reason "what was done"` or `bn bug close ID --reason "what was done"` BEFORE running `bn goodbye`. Run `bn goodbye "summary of what was accomplished"` to gracefully terminate your agent session when all work is done.
