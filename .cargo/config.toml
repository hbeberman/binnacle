# WASM target configuration
# To build for WASM, use:
#   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
#   cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features wasm --lib

[target.wasm32-unknown-unknown]
# Use wasm-bindgen for JS interop
rustflags = ["-C", "target-feature=+atomics,+bulk-memory,+mutable-globals"]

[build]
# Keep native as the default target (don't set target here)
# WASM builds must explicitly specify --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
